6. License Grant (Software / SDK / Widget)
------------------------------------------
If you obtain Software from Cotopia under a distribution that specifies a license (for example GPLv3 as provided in our LICENSE.md), the terms of that license control your rights to use, modify and redistribute that Software. Where Cotopia distributes Software under GPLv3, your use, modification and redistribution of that Software is governed entirely by the GPLv3 (see LICENSE.md). Separate commercial licensing (dual-licensing) may be available under a written agreement with Cotopia; contact support@cotopia.org to inquire.

7. Restrictions
---------------
You agree not to:
- Copy, modify, create derivative works of, or redistribute the Hosted Service except as expressly authorized;  
- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive source code from the Hosted Service (this does not apply to Software you receive under an open-source license that permits such actions);  
- Use the Service to transmit malware, spam, or illegal content;  
- Use the Service in a manner that violates applicable laws, infringes third-party rights, or that Cotopia reasonably believes may harm the Service or other users;  
- Bypass technical protections, remove notices, or attempt to interfere with usage instrumentation and analytics of the Service.

8. User Content; Ownership; License to Cotopia
----------------------------------------------
- You retain ownership of User Content you submit. You represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to submit the User Content and to grant Cotopia the rights below.  
- By submitting User Content to the Hosted Service you grant Cotopia a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and display the User Content solely to provide, operate, improve and secure the Service, to provide support, and to comply with legal obligations. Cotopia will not claim ownership of your User Content.  
- Cotopia may process, aggregate and anonymize usage data and analytics; Cotopia retains all rights to such aggregated, de-identified data and may use it for product improvement, benchmarks, research and marketing.

9. Privacy; Data Processing
---------------------------
Cotopia’s Privacy Policy describes our handling of personal data and gives details on processors (e.g., Stripe, analytics providers). By using the Service you agree to the Privacy Policy. If you process personal data of data subjects in the EU/EEA, Cotopia will enter a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) upon request to satisfy GDPR obligations; contact support@cotopia.org.

10. Fees, Billing & Payment
---------------------------
- Paid features are provided on subscription or one-time license terms as specified on your order form or the website.  
- Fees are quoted in the order currency and are non-refundable except as specified in these Terms or required by law.  
- For subscriptions, Cotopia will bill via your chosen payment provider (we recommend Stripe). You authorize Cotopia to charge your payment method for all fees and applicable taxes.  
- If a payment is overdue, Cotopia may suspend access to paid features until payment is received, and may charge interest on late payments as permitted by law. For enterprise deals, payment terms (e.g., Net-30) must be in writing.

11. Trials, Refunds, and Cancellation
------------------------------------
- Trials: Cotopia may offer trial periods. You must cancel before the trial ends to avoid charges unless otherwise stated.  
- Cancellation: You may cancel your subscription at any time; cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current paid term unless otherwise agreed.  
- Refunds: Refunds are granted only in accordance with Cotopia’s refund policy (published or provided during purchase) or as required by law. Example: a 14-day refund window for annual plans may be offered, subject to verification and Cotopia’s sole discretion.

12. Taxes
---------
You are responsible for any taxes (except for Cotopia’s income tax) arising from your purchase and use of the Service. Cotopia may collect taxes where required by law and will show taxes on your invoice.

13. Modifications to the Service & Terms
----------------------------------------
- Cotopia may modify or update the Service and Documentation from time to time. Cotopia will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of significant changes.  
- Cotopia may modify these Terms; for material changes we will provide advance notice. Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the new Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service and cancel any paid subscriptions.

14. Acceptable Use & Prohibited Content
--------------------------------------
You agree not to use the Service to host, store or transmit content that:
- Violates applicable law or regulation;  
- Infringes intellectual property or other rights of third parties;  
- Is defamatory, obscene, harassing, hateful, or promotes violence;  
- Constitutes personal data processed unlawfully.

Cotopia may remove content that violates these rules or suspend accounts for violations.

15. Intellectual Property Rights
--------------------------------
- Cotopia (and its licensors) retain all right, title and interest in and to the Service (including all Software, Documentation, trademarks and know-how) except for your User Content and any open-source components where the copyright holders license under their open-source terms.  
- If you submit feedback or suggestions, you grant Cotopia a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use such feedback without restriction.

16. Third-Party Services & Integrations
---------------------------------------
The Service may integrate with third-party services (payment processors, analytics, marketplaces). Use of those services may require separate accounts and acceptance of their terms. Cotopia is not responsible for third-party service availability or their privacy/security practices.

17. Security & Data Protection
------------------------------
Cotopia employs reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data. However, no service can be 100% secure; you acknowledge this risk. For high-security or regulated use cases, contact Cotopia for enterprise deployment or on-premises options.

18. Backups & Data Retention
----------------------------
Cotopia performs routine backups per its policies. You are responsible for retaining copies of critical data. Cotopia will retain data in accordance with its retention policy and applicable laws; specific retention periods can be agreed in enterprise contracts.

19. Warranties; Disclaimers
---------------------------
- The Service is provided “as is” and “as available.” Except as expressly set out in a signed agreement, Cotopia disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement.  
- Cotopia does not warrant the Service will meet your requirements, be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. Where Cotopia provides Software under an open-source license, the warranty disclaimers in that license apply.

20. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- Neither Cotopia nor its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents or suppliers will be liable for: indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages (including loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, business interruption) arising from or related to the Service, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.  
- Cotopia’s aggregate liability arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the amounts actually paid by you to Cotopia under these Terms in the 12 months preceding the claim (or $100 if you have not paid Cotopia).  
Some jurisdictions do not allow limitation of liability for consequential damages; in those jurisdictions the above limitation may not apply.

21. Indemnification
-------------------
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Cotopia, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claim, loss, liability, damage, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) your breach of these Terms; (b) your negligence or willful misconduct; (c) your User Content; or (d) your violation of third-party rights or applicable law.

22. Termination & Suspension
----------------------------
- Cotopia may suspend or terminate your Account or access to the Service for breach of these Terms, non-payment, security incidents, or if required by law. Cotopia will provide notice when feasible.  
- You may terminate these Terms by discontinuing use of the Service and cancelling subscriptions. Termination does not relieve you of outstanding payment obligations.  
- Upon termination, Cotopia may delete or anonymize your Account and User Content after any applicable retention period. Cotopia may provide export tools prior to deletion where feasible; back up your data before termination.

23. Survival
------------
Sections that by their nature survive termination or expiration of these Terms include: Fees, Payments & Taxes (as applicable), Ownership, User Content, Privacy, Warranties & Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Termination, Governing Law & Dispute Resolution, and other provisions which should reasonably survive.

24. DMCA / Copyright Policy
---------------------------
Cotopia respects copyright. If you believe your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide a written notice with the information required by the DMCA to Cotopia’s designated agent (support@cotopia.org). Cotopia will respond to valid DMCA notices per the law and its policies.

25. Export Controls
-------------------
You must comply with applicable export and import laws and regulations. You will not access or use the Service in violation of such laws. Cotopia may restrict access for users in sanctioned countries or where use would violate applicable export laws.

26. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
--------------------------------------
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Except for injunctive relief actions, disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Wyoming. You and Cotopia consent to personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you are contracting within the European Union or other jurisdictions with mandatory consumer protections, certain local rules may apply.

27. Injunctive Relief
---------------------
You acknowledge that breach of certain provisions (e.g., confidentiality, intellectual property rights) may cause irreparable harm to Cotopia for which remedies at law are inadequate; Cotopia may seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies.

28. Changes to These Terms
--------------------------
Cotopia may update these Terms from time to time. For material updates, Cotopia will provide advance notice (e.g., 30 days). Continued use after notice constitutes acceptance. If you do not accept the updated Terms you must stop using the Service.

29. Entire Agreement
--------------------
These Terms (together with any order forms, enterprise agreements, DPA, or other documents expressly incorporated) constitute the entire agreement between you and Cotopia regarding the Service and supersede all prior understandings.

30. Severability
----------------
If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

31. No Waiver
-------------
Failing to enforce a right under these Terms does not waive Cotopia’s right to enforce it later.

32. Independent Contractors
---------------------------
The parties are independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms creates a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment relationship.

33. Assignment
--------------
You may not assign or transfer these Terms, or any rights or obligations hereunder, without Cotopia’s prior written consent. Cotopia may assign these Terms in whole or part to a successor (e.g., in connection with a merger or sale).

34. Promotional Use; Trademark
------------------------------
Cotopia may publish aggregated usage statistics and anonymized case studies. You grant Cotopia a limited, non-exclusive right to use your name and logo for marketing if you are a Subscriber, unless you opt out in writing. Cotopia retains all trademark rights; you may not use Cotopia trademarks except with Cotopia’s prior written permission.

35. Enterprise and Developer Agreements
---------------------------------------
Enterprise customers and developer/reseller partners may request customized agreements (MSA, SLA, Developer/Reseller Agreement) which will supersede these Terms where mutually signed and explicitly stated. Contact support@cotopia.org to initiate negotiations.

36. Accessibility
-----------------
Cotopia aims to make the Service accessible. Contact support@cotopia.org with accessibility issues or requests for accommodations.

37. Additional Provisions for Open Source / GPLv3 Distribution
--------------------------------------------------------------
- If Cotopia supplies Software under an open-source license such as GPLv3, the terms of that license govern your use of that Software. Cotopia’s distribution of open-source Software will include a copy of the applicable license (e.g., LICENSE.md). GPLv3 grants rights to copy, modify and redistribute under GPLv3 terms; it also includes warranty disclaimers and obligations when you convey object code.  
- Note: GPLv3 does not by itself compel Cotopia to release source code for Hosted Service operations. If you require network-use source obligations, consider AGPLv3-licensed Software.

38. Contact & Notices
---------------------
For notices under these Terms (other than billing or support), contact: support@cotopia.org. Legal notices should be sent to the address associated with Cotopia legal records; Cotopia may update its contact details on its website.

39. Miscellaneous
-----------------
- Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.  
- References to “including” mean “including without limitation”.

40. Sample Policy Summaries (for quick reference)
-------------------------------------------------
- Refunds: limited, as disclosed at purchase; typically annual plans may have a 14-day refund window.  
- Data export: Customers should export their User Content prior to termination; Cotopia may support exports for terminated Accounts where feasible.  
- Support: Email support at support@cotopia.org; paid plans receive priority SLA terms as defined in order forms or enterprise agreements.
